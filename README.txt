This is a GitHub repo for a Discord bot written in Discord.py rewrite. To activate the bot, you will need to goto the Discord Developer Portal and paste the hidden token. This bot has 3 commands ping (a test command and will say pong in return), sum (will show the sum of 2 numbers for example: "sum 5 6" and then the bot will respnd with 11), and info (shows server info like When the server is created or who is the owner). Feel free to copy the code and modify it.
